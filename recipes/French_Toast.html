    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A timeless breakfast classic, this French toast recipe creates a dish that is wonderfully custardy on the inside with a crisp, golden-brown exterior. The secret is using thick-sliced, slightly stale bread which soaks up the rich egg mixture without becoming soggy. It's a simple yet elegant meal perfect for a lazy weekend brunch.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 slices thick-cut bread</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>A cup of milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon granulated cinnamon</li>
        <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Marple syrup</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the Custard: In a shallow dish (like a pie plate), whisk together the eggs, milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, sugar, and salt until well combined and frothy.</li>
        <li>Soak the Bread: Dip each slice of bread into the egg mixture, allowing it to soak for about 20-30 seconds on each side. The bread should be fully saturated but not falling apart.</li>
        <li>Cook the French Toast: Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and melt a tablespoon of butter. Place the soaked bread slices on the skillet, being careful not to overcrowd it. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and crisp.

        </li>
        <li>Serve: Serve immediately, topped with a pat of butter, a drizzle of warm maple syrup, and a dusting of powdered sugar if desired.</li>
    </ol>
