            Dip each slice of bread into the egg custard, allowing it to soak for about 20-30 seconds on each side until it is saturated but not falling apa

            Melt butter on a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the soaked bread slices on the hot skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, until each side is beautifully golden brown and the center is cooked through.
